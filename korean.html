<h2 id="adjective">Adjective</h2>
<p>Adjectives in Korean are an essential part of the language, used to describe or modify nouns.</p>
<p>Here’s a summary of the key points related to Korean adjectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Adjective types: Korean adjectives can be divided into two main categories - descriptive and determinative. Descriptive adjectives describe the qualities of a noun (e.g., 큰 “big”, 작은 “small”), while determinative adjectives indicate a specific noun (e.g., 이/그/저 “this/that/that over there”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjective endings: Korean adjectives typically end in -ㄴ, -는, or -은 when used to modify a noun. For example, 작은 (small) 책 (book) becomes 작은 책 (small book).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjective conjugation: Unlike English, Korean adjectives can be conjugated to reflect tense, politeness level, and the speaker’s relationship to the listener. When used in a sentence, adjectives are conjugated similarly to verbs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Present tense: 크다 (to be big) becomes 큰 (big) when modifying a noun and 크다/커요/큽니다 (is big) when used as a predicate.</li>
<li>Past tense: 크다 (to be big) becomes 컸다/컸어요/컸습니다 (was big) when used as a predicate.</li>
<li>Future tense: 크다 (to be big) becomes 클 거예요/클 것입니다 (will be big) when used as a predicate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comparatives and superlatives: In Korean, adjectives don’t have specific comparative or superlative forms like in English. Instead, comparative and superlative meanings are expressed using other words or particles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Comparative: 더 (more) or 보다 (than) are used for comparisons, e.g., 이 책은 저 책보다 더 큰 책이에요 (This book is bigger than that book).</li>
<li>Superlative: 가장 (the most) is used to indicate the superlative form of an adjective, e.g., 가장 큰 책 (the biggest book).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Negation: To negate an adjective, the adverb 안 (not) is used before the adjective, e.g., 안 큰 책 (not a big book).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using adjectives as adverbs: In Korean, adjectives can also function as adverbs without any additional changes. To use an adjective as an adverb, simply place it before a verb.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: 빨리 걷다 (to walk quickly) - 빨리 (quickly) is the adverb form of the adjective 빠르다 (to be fast).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compound adjectives: Korean adjectives can be combined to form compound adjectives, which describe a noun with two or more characteristics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: 작고 귀여운 강아지 (a small and cute puppy) - 작다 (small) and 귀엽다 (cute) are combined to describe the puppy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjective nominalization: Adjectives can be turned into nouns by attaching the nominalization suffix -ㅁ or -음.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: 높다 (to be high) becomes 높음 (height); 넓다 (to be wide) becomes 넓음 (width).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjective intensifiers: Certain adverbs can be used to intensify the meaning of an adjective, similar to “very” or “extremely” in English.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: 아주 예쁘다 (very pretty), 매우 빠르다 (very fast), 너무 크다 (too big).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjective linking: To link two or more adjectives in a sentence, the conjunction -고 can be attached to the stem of the first adjective.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: 작고 빨간 자동차 (a small and red car) - 작다 (small) and 빨갛다 (red) are linked by -고.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjective reduplication: Some adjectives can be reduplicated to convey emphasis or repetition.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: 조용조용하다 (very quiet, hushed) - 조용하다 (quiet) is reduplicated for emphasis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjective opposites: Some Korean adjectives have opposite meanings, which can be useful to know for expanding your vocabulary and understanding context.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Example: 길다 (long) and 짧다 (short); 높다 (high) and 낮다 (low); 덥다 (hot) and 춥다 (cold).</li>
</ul>
<ol start="14">
<li>Adjective derivation: New adjectives can be derived from existing adjectives or nouns by adding the suffix -적, -스럽다, or -답다.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Example: 안전하다 (safe) can be derived from 안전 (safety) + -하다; 아름답다 (beautiful) can be derived from 아름 (beauty) + -답다.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="15">
<li>
<p>Adjective agreement: In Korean, adjectives do not change their form to agree with the noun they modify in terms of gender, number, or case. This simplifies adjective usage compared to some other languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Irregular adjectives: Some Korean adjectives have irregular conjugation patterns, which may require memorization and practice to master.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Example: 좋다 (to be good) has an irregular conjugation pattern, becoming 좋은 when modifying a noun and 좋아요/좋습니다 as a predicate.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="17">
<li>Honorific adjectives: In formal contexts or when speaking to someone of higher status, certain honorific adjectives can be used to show respect.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Example: 귀하다 (honorable) and 훌륭하다 (excellent) are examples of honorific adjectives.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="18">
<li>Adjective order: In Korean, there is no strict order for multiple adjectives modifying a noun. Instead, the most important or prominent adjective is usually placed closest to the noun.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Example: 작은 빨간 자동차 (small red car) or 빨간 작은 자동차 (red small car) - both orders are acceptable.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="19">
<li>Adjective negation with 못: In some cases, the adverb 못 (cannot) can be used before the adjective to express inability or incapability.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Example: 못 먹는 음식 (food that cannot be eaten) - 못 is used to negate 먹다 (to eat).</li>
</ul>
<ol start="20">
<li>Adjective usage in idiomatic expressions: Korean has numerous idioms and expressions that use adjectives in unique ways, often with meanings that differ from their literal translation.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Example: 말이 없다 (to have no words) is an idiomatic expression meaning to be speechless or amazed, even though 말 (words) is a noun and 없다 (to not have) is an adjective.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="number-system">Number system</h2>
<p>Korean has two number systems: Sino-number (Chinese) and Native-number</p>
<p>Here’s a summary of when to use native Korean numbers (하나, 둘,셋,넷,다섯,여섯,일곱,여덟,아홉,열, 열하나…) and Sino-Korean numbers (일,이,삼,사,오,육,칠,팔,구,십) in different contexts:</p>
